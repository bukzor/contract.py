wish bucket:
  . split earley parser out
  . check_value() should probably produce a magical function
    that someone dissociates itself from the references to the
    parse tree
  . grep for 'horrible'

more schemas that ought to work:
  . int -> int? # takes an int, will return either an int or None
  . lists
